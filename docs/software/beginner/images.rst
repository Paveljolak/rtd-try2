About the Pi Images
-------------------

Ubiquity Robotics provides Raspberry Pi images based on Ubuntu, 
pre-installed with `ROS 2 <https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html>`_ 
for out of the box robotics development.

These images are tested on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5. Older models (like Pi 3 or earlier) are 
not officially supported and may not work reliably.
